# React-Native SUMMER FUN APP

## Author: Lena Eivy

## Summary: 
This app provides endless hours of summer fun ideas to combat the "I'm bored" syndrome. With a built in points system to encourage task completion, children will be over the moon when they get their hands on this app.

## Plans for future development: 
Currently there are 14 built in activites and points assigned to each activity. Future versions will have the ability for parents to add their own activites and assign point values to those activites. 

## To use the app:
Currently the app is not deployed to the app store or Google Play so to use the app, you must do the following:
1. download the expo app onto your phone
2. use your phone's camera to scan this QR code

3. This will launch the app in your phone. You can now play around with the features. 
* click the "I'm bored" button and a random activity will be generated along with a point value. This activity will be spoken in case the children don't know how to read yet
* if you complete the activity, you can click the "Task Complete" button and the points from that activity will be added to your total point score at the top of the page
